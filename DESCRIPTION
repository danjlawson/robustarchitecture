Title: Estimate Genomic Architecture parameters using robust statistics
Version: 0.0.1

Description: robustarchitecture is a package to estimate genomic architecture parameters - i.e. the relationship between minor allele frequency and effect size - using only extreme effect SNPs. This makes the inference robust to estimation issues, and model mis-specification issues.
